## Gym tracker
This project is a web-based application that keeps a track of the days the user went to the GYM or simply exercised. It helps users to understand how many days they completed their workout. This indirectly helps them to create a schedule that would include more exercise than usual if they do not complete the same regularly. An analytics section is also provided which makes it easier for the users to visualize their workout routine. The UI is kept simple for easier navigation.
